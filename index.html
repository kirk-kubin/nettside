            <p>Hello, my name is Leon Furulund, upcoming rockstar! I make punk/grunge rock music that is heavily inspired by the band Nirvana.</p>
            <p>I am a one man band at the moment, making the drums digitally on FL Studio, and playing guitar and lowering it digitally to make it sound like a bass.</p>
            <p>But I'm currently working with someone also named Leon, who plays drums. Now we just need a bassist, haha.</p>

            <p>This website is for anyone who wants to know more about my music, and for those who'd want to hire me.</p>
            <p>I can play live, even though I prefer the studio. I can play almost anything you throw at me with enough practice.</p>
